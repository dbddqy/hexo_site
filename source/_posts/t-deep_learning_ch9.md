# Unsupervised Learning and Generative Models

## Auto-encoder

- latent info extraction
- dimension reduction

## Variational Auto-encoder

- generative
- the latent variable should follow a known distribution
- after training, use decoder only to generate new sample

## GAN

- use a Generator and a Discriminator network
- mini-max optimization: difficult to train
